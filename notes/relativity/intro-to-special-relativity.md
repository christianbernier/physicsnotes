## Classical Relativity

### What is relativity?

In general, the concept of **relativity** allows observers in different *frames of reference* to compare observations of phenomena.

**Intertial frames of reference** are those that do not involve any rotation or acceleration, where all of Newton's laws apply. Examples of an inertial frame of reference would be floating in a nonrotating rocket in interstellar space, away from any meaningful effects of gravity. The surface of Earth is sometimes accepted as close enough to inertial for some observations, but observers are still subject to Earth's gravitational force and rotation.

A **transformation** describes how to change observations from one frame of reference into another. Transformations are often expressed as a system of equations, comparing two observers' (often denoted $O$ and $O'$) perceived location in spacetime, $(x, y, z, t)$.

### Galilean transformations

In classical physics, a set of transformations known as **Galilean transformations** are used. For an observer $O'$ moving at velocity $u$ in the positive $x$ direction with respect to observer $O$, the following equations describe the classical relativity:

$$
x'=x-ut
$$
$$
y'=y
$$
$$
z'=z
$$
$$
t'=t
$$

Note: the last equation, $t'=t$, means that in Galilean transformations time is the same for all observers.

Taking the derivative of each equation with respect to time (this works because time is the same for all observers), we find the Galilean velocity transformations as such:

$$
v_x'=v_x-u
$$
$$
v_y'=v_y
$$
$$
v_z'=v_z
$$

Finally, the Galilean acceleration transformations are as follows:


$$
a_x'=a_x
$$
$$
a_y'=a_y
$$
$$
a_z'=a_z
$$

## The Michelson-Morley Experiment

Physicists postulated about a medium called *ether*, which light waves propagated through, to explain relativistic effects to do with light.

To test their hypothesis, Michelson and Morley used monochromatic light split by a half-silvered mirror. This would then reflect half of the light and let the other half pass through. The light beams would then be reflected by mirrors, and recombined in the center before being shone on an observing plate.

Any phase difference in the light would result in interference, meaning there would be bands of light. Michelson and Morley suspected this phase difference would result from two factors:

1. The slight difference in distances between the mirrors on their experimental setup
2. The effects of the ether wind on the light waves (the idea was that light would move faster one way because of a backwind and faster another way because of a headwind)

To cancel the effects of the first factor, they rotated their apparatus 90 degrees to change the setup's movement through the ether (all the cross-stream ether wind would become upstream/downstream and vice versa). After careful observation, however, they saw no noticeable difference in the fringe pattern produced by the light, meaning their theory of such a medium was unsupported.

## Einstein's Postulates

Einstein's *special theory of relativity* attempts to accurately describe the motion of particles (including light) moving at high velocities, where classical relativity falls short.

The theory is based on two postulates:

1. The principle of relativity: the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference
2. The principle of the constancy of the speed of light: the speed of light in free space has the same value, $c$, to all observers in inertial frames of reference

These postulates mean there can be no physical laws that are valid in one inertial frame of reference and invalid in any other inertial frame of reference. Additionally, this means there is no "preferred frame of reference" for observations in the universe.

Due to the constancy of the speed of light, Galilean transformations do not suffice. Instead, relativistic transformations are used.
