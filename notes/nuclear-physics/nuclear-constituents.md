## Historical Postulates

Physicists have historically postulated that the nucleus of an atom contains a certain number of electrons, to balance the nuclear charge of an atom ($+Z$) with the atomic mass number $A$. However, this prediction does not match the experimental results from the nuclear magnetic moment (which shows that protons have spin $1/2$).

## Neutrons

The neutron was discovered as an nuclear constituent in 1932. In the proton-neutron model, atoms of atomic number $Z$ have $Z$ protons and $A-Z$ neutrons, such that the atomic mass number is $A$. Chemical properties of an element depend only on the atomic number $Z$. 

| Name | Symbol | Charge | Mass | Rest energy | Spin
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----
| Proton | $p$ | $+e$ | $1.007276~\text{u}$ | $938.28~\text{MeV}$ | $\frac{1}{2}$
| Neutron | $n$ | $+0$ | $1.008665~\text{u}$ | $939.57~\text{MeV}$ | $\frac{1}{2}$

### Isotopes
Atoms of the same atomic number with different mass numbers are called *isotopes*. Isotopes with atomic number $Z$, mass number $A$, and neutron number $N$ ($N=A-Z$) are written as

$$^A_ZX_N$$

Since $X$ (a chemical symbol) and $Z$ hold the same information, $Z$ is not necessary. And with both the atomic number and mass number, $N$ is not necessary. Therefore, isotopes are compactly written as $^1H$, $^2H$, etc.
